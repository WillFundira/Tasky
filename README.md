# Tasky
Tasky is a simple to-do-list app written primarily in HTMl and Python, with some CSS styling.
Tasky allows authenticated users to create, edit , delete and update tasks in a basic form of CRUD Database Management. 


I utilized class based views instead of the conventional function based views by followng Django Documentation found at the link below:
